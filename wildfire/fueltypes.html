<h2>GR1 (101)<br>
Short, Sparse Dry Climate Grass </h2>
<img src='./images/fueltypes/101_a.png' height="200" width="200">
<img src='./images/fueltypes/101_b.png' height="200" width="200">
<p>
Description: The primary carrier of fire in GR1 is sparse grass, though small amounts
of fine dead fuel may be present. The grass in GR1 is generally short, either naturally
or by grazing, and may be sparse or discontinuous. The moisture of extinction of GR1
is indicative of a dry climate fuelbed, but GR1 may also be applied in high-extinction
moisture fuelbeds because in both cases predicted spread rate and flame length are
low compared to other GR models.</p>
